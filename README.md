Automatically add events to Google Calendar when you recieve a certain type of email. Paste it into a [Google Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) and add the Gmail and Calendar services to the project. It will ask you to give the app permission the first time you run it.

Add a trigger for either every few hours or every time you recieve an email.

I get an email every time someone schedules an online class with me, so this saves time that would otherwise be spent manually creating calendar events.

Filters through emails from a chosen sender, by subject using regex and then uses the date and time to create an event.
