Automatically add events to Google Calendar when you recieve a certain type of email. Paste it into a Google Script and add the Gmail and Calendar services to the project. It will ask you to give the app permission the first time you run it.

Add a trigger for either every few hours or every time you recieve an email.

I get notifications every time an online class session is scheduled which was my motive for writing this.

Filters through emails from a chosen sender, by subject using regex and then uses the date and time to create an event.
